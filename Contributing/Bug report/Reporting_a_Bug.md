Reporting a Bug
Edit this page
Whenever you find a bug in CARBON'AREA, we kindly ask you to report it. It helps us make a better calculator.

If you think you've found a security issue, please use the special procedure instead.

Before submitting a bug:

Double-check the official documentation to see if you're not misusing the framework;
Ask for assistance on offical discord 3WA - BZH if you're not sure if your issue really is a bug.
If your problem definitely looks like a bug, report it using the official bug tracker from and follow some basic rules:

Use the title field to clearly describe the issue;
Describe the steps needed to reproduce the bug with short code examples (providing a unit test that illustrates the bug is best);
If the bug you experienced is not simple or affects more than one layer, providing a simple failing unit test may not be sufficient. In this case, please provide a reproducer;
Give as much detail as possible about your environment (OS, PHP version, Symfony version, enabled extensions, ...);
If there was an exception and you would like to report it, it is valuable to provide the stack trace for that exception. If you want to provide a stack trace you got on an HTML page, be sure to provide the plain text version, which should appear at the bottom of the page. Do not provide it as a screenshot, since search engines will not be able to index the text inside them. Same goes for errors encountered in a terminal, do not take a screenshot, but copy/paste the contents. If the stack trace is long, consider enclosing it in a <details> HTML tag. Be wary that stack traces may contain sensitive information, and if it is the case, be sure to redact them prior to posting your stack trace.
(optional) Attach a patch.
